      <p>A battle ensues. You swing your sword hitting the dragon causing</p>
      <p>little damage. Inferno's scales are too thick to penetrate with a slashing</p>
      <p>attack. Inferno retaliates by smashing you with his tail. As you're</p>
      <p>flying accross the cave, Almric is firing arrow after arrow at Inferno</p>
      <p>to no avail. The arrows can't pierce his scales. After you strike the wall,</p>
      <p>Inferno turns to Almric and shoots fire out of his mouth. Almric dodges</p>
      <p>only to be pinned by the dragons claws. You regain your senses and charge</p>
      <p>the dragon while he is distracted with Almric. Just before Inferno</p>
      <p>rips Almric to shreds, you strike. Your sword bites deep into Inferno's neck.</p>
      <p>Inferno screams and flails as his lifeforce leaves him. You have vanquished</p>
      <p>the dragon. You return to the king having completed your quest. You are</p>
      <p>exclaimed defenders of the land and showered in riches. You live in peace</p>
      <p>until the next adventure.</p>
