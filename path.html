      <p>You and Almric have come across what seems to be</p>
      <p>the most beautiful and quiet path in the forest.</p>
      <p>There is wildlife all around. You feel at peace.</p>
      <p>Your mount is trying to go quickly, but you reign him in,</p>
      <p>wanting to spend more time in this serene place.</p>
      <p>After a while, you realize you need to get back to your quest.</p>
      <p>You urge your mount into a gallop. Before long you come to</p>
      <p>a mountain.</p>
